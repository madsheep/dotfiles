# lubieniebieski/dotfiles

This repository contains my settings for mostly for bash and irb console. It is based on my favourite dotfiles:

* [ryanb/dotfiles](https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles) - core for other files
* [iain/osx_settings](https://github.com/iain/osx_settings/) - irbrc
* [twerth/dotfiles](https://github.com/twerth/dotfiles) - bashrc

## Installation

Installation is very simple:

    git clone git://github.com/lubieniebieski/dotfiles.git
    cd dotfiles/
    ./install.sh
## TODO

* Sublime Text 2:
** user Key Bindings
** user File Settings

## Credits

Thanks for all the people who care about their terminals :)

# lubieniebieski/dotfiles

This repository contains my settings (mostly) for bash and irb console. It is based on the following dotfiles:

* [ryanb/dotfiles](https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles) - core for other files
* [iain/osx_settings](https://github.com/iain/osx_settings/) - irbrc
* [twerth/dotfiles](https://github.com/twerth/dotfiles) - bashrc

I didn't introduce many changes in any of the dotfiles, I rather combined them together in order to utilise the best features of each dotfiles.

## Installation

Installation is very simple:

    git clone git://github.com/lubieniebieski/dotfiles.git
    cd dotfiles/
    git submodule init
    git submoudle update
    ./install.sh

## TODO

* Sublime Text 2:
    * user Key Bindings
    * user File Settings

## Credits

Thanks for all the people who care about their terminals :)
